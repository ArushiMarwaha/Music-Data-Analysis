## Data Analyst Case Study

Welcome to the Data Analyst Case Study! This project delves into the analysis of a music dataset using Excel, focusing on cleaning and examining various aspects related to music. Below is a comprehensive overview of the conducted analysis:

### Overview
The primary goal of this case study is to explore different dimensions of the music dataset, covering key distribution, song duration, predictive factors for streams, engagement rates of YouTube videos, title analysis, and momentum calculation.

### Analysis Highlights
1. **Visualizing Key Distribution**: A visualization was created to easily identify the most frequently occurring key and the distribution of keys across all music entries in the dataset.

2. **Duration Conversion**: The duration of each song was converted into minutes and seconds, and a table was provided to showcase the number of songs grouped by duration in minutes.

3. **Predictive Factors for Streams**: Analysis was conducted on factors such as Loudness, Speechiness, Acousticness, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Valence, and Tempo to determine which one most significantly predicts the number of streams.

4. **Engagement Rate Calculation**: The engagement rate for each YouTube video was computed, and a comparison was made between the performance of official videos versus unofficial ones.

5. **Title Analysis**: The number of words in each YouTube title was determined, and an investigation was conducted to ascertain if the number of words impacts the number of views of the video.

6. **Momentum Calculation**: A new metric called Momentum was introduced, calculated as the number of YouTube views divided by the number of days since release. This metric aids in understanding the momentum of a song, and the song with the highest momentum was identified.
